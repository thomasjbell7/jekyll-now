* Decided against continuing with the Business Communications course. I skipped through the rest of the course and decided that it's very basic, and that my time is better spent learning and physically building websites.
* Spent the rest of my time finally confirming my next steps. I have a solid plan of action now.

Time spent today: 3.72 hours
