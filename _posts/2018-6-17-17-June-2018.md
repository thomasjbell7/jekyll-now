* FINALLY completed 'vigenere' in pset 2 of CS50. So happy!
* Watched the lecture and all shorts from week 2 of CS50
* Started to work through 'crack' in pset 2 of CS50, but then stopped. I think that I might give that one a miss, because I don't fully grasp what's being asked of me yet, and the 'music' problem in pset 3 intrigued me! I don't need to do 'crack' in order to pass CS50 anyway, so it's not a huge issue.
