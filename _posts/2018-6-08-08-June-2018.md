* Started You Don't Know JS again. Completed book one (Up & Going).
* Enrolled into the Harvard University's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) course and watched the lecture for Week 0.

I plan to work on You Don't Know JS and CS50 at the same time going forwards, as a bit of variation.

Time spent today: 6.6 hours  
Total time spent: 58.41 hours
