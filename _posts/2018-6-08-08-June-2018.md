* Started You Don't Know JS again. Completed book one (Up & Going).
* Enrolled into the Harvard University's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) course.

I plan to work on You Don't Know JS and CS50 at the same time going forwards, as a bit of variation.

Time spent today: 5.47 hours  
Total time spent: 57.28 hours
