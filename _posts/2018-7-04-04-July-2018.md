I've not posted recently because I've been on holiday, having an awesome time in Zante! I got back yesterday afternoon, so today is my first day back in action!

* Completed the command line portion of the [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) website
* Had a scan through [The Art Of The Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line#everyday-use) - I'm not sure how much of this (or Linux Journey above) I'll remember!
* Read through Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) course

Time spent today: 2.65 hours  
Total time spent: 145.87 hours
