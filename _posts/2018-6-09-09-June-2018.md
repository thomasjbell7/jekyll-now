* Enrolled into the Arizona State University's [College Algebra and Problem Solving](https://www.edx.org/course/college-algebra-problem-solving-asux-mat117x) course because I know mathematics will be very useful to me in the future when I'm looking at algorithms. I also read some information and watched videos explaining how this course works.
* Enrolled into Saylor Academy's [Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345) course because it's in the P1XT FAQ and sounds interesting. I also went through the course syllabus.
* Read more about some of P1XT's courses, and used the guides to figure out what I should be doing now/next. I know I won't follow them completely, but they will help a lot
* Watched all of CS50's [Project 5050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLhQjrBD2T383RLDItqbDRs-4gWy8Wgec2&v=0S7isdzIBU4) playlist.

For the forseeable future I plan to run through things in a particular order:

1. Complete one of the six books of 'You Don't Know JS'
2. Complete a week of CS50
3. Complete a unit of the Business Communications course
4. Do part of the College Algebra and Problem Solving course until a good stopping point
5. Go back to step one

Once I've completed a course/book, I'll replace that with something new. Because I completed the first book of 'You Don't Know JS' yesterday, and also watched the lecture of week 0 of CS50, the next thing to do is complete problem set 0 of CS50. This means I'm currently on step 2 of the above ordered list.
