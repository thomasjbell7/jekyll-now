* Joined [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.com) and started to work through the curriculum. I’m starting at ‘Early Math’ and I’m intending to learn up to at least precalculus, so this may take a while.
* Read up more on P1xt’s guide and bookmarked useful websites from there
* Set up my programming environment, including Git
* Started to read [You Don’t Know JS – Up and Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md)
– Read Foreword, Preface, and Chapter 1: Into Programming.
