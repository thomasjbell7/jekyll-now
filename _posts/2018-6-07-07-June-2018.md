* Continued with Basic JavaScript in FCC. Finding it a lot more difficult than I thought I would. I'm stuck on ['Record Collection'](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/record-collection) at the moment. I'm really struggling with arrays. I'm thinking about starting the entire Basic JavaScript module again tomorrow, or possibly go through You Don't Know JS.

Time spent today: 3.42 hours  
Total time spent: 51.81 hours
