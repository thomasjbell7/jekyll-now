* Completed problem set 0 of CS50
* Watched the lecture from week 1 of CS50 and set up the IDE
* Started to work through pset 1 of CS50

I've changed my mind (again). I'm going to do the entire CS50 course before I start anything else because I'm enjoying it too much.

Time spent today: 6.72 hours  
Total time spent: 70.80 hours
