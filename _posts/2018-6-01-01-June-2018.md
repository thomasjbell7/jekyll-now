* Continued with FreeCodeCamp - completed Applied Visual Design. I don't think I'll remember much of it but we'll see.
* Spent some more time reading Swyx's [blog](https://sw-yx.github.io/2017/12/19/fcc-blogpost-draft-2). This is a very interesting post and it's similar to what I'd like to do!
* Read about (and started) [100 days of code](http://100daysofcode.com/). Hopefully I'll manage at least this!

Time spent today: 3.67 hours  
Total time spent: 24.35 hours
