* Continued with FreeCodeCamp - continued Applied Visual Design
* Spent some more time reading Swyx's [blog](https://sw-yx.github.io/2017/12/19/fcc-blogpost-draft-2). This is a very interesting post and it's similar to what I'd like to do!
* Read about [100 days of code](https://sw-yx.github.io/2017/12/19/fcc-blogpost-draft-2). Hopefully I'll manage at least this!

Time spent today: TBC
