title: 09 June 2019 - This time it's serious!
---

As you can see, I haven't updated this blog since almost a year ago, and to be honest it's because I haven't really done anything since my last blog post. My last post mentioned that I wasn't happy with my performance since I returned from holiday, and that's because I lost focus, and shortly after that post I stopped completely.

However - this is one of my long term goals, and for that reason - I'm back!

I'll only be following one guide this time - P1xt's [Computer Science and Programming - Version 4.0](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) guide. I've slightly amended it to fit me a bit better, and you can follow my progress by clicking [here](https://github.com/thomasjbell7/p1xt-guides/blob/master/README.md). I'm currently working my way through Khan Adademy's math course.

I'm no longer going to be tracking my total time spent or posting daily, so this blog will be used to post interesting things that I learn or what I'm working on. Although, for the record, I started again on 27 May 2019.

Hopefully I'll stick with this a bit longer this time!
