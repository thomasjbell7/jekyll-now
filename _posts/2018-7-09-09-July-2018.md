* Completed another section from the HTML/CSS course I’ve been doing.
* Spent some time pondering on what to do next.

I have a couple of things to note. Firstly, after I completed the 'good' parts of CS50, I went on holiday, and since then I've felt really unmotivated and unable to focus. I don't think I'm enjoying the course I'm doing at the moment and I now plan to go back to FreeCodeCamp. I do enjoy FreeCodeCamp, and the only reason I took a detour is because I didn't understand some of the JavaScript. Hopefully I'll undetstand it all better a second time round.

Seperately, I’ve decided I’m going to purely focus on learning web development, up until the point where I definitely need math. When I need math I’ll know exactly what I need to learn. I’d rather put 100% of my focus on learning web development as I’m a beginner at the moment.
