* Spent some more time working out what I should do when I've completed CS50
* Based on advice from [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), I've decided to stop working through CS50 once it moves away from C. This means that the last thing I will do in CS50 is watch the lecture that is part 1 of week 6, before moving on to something else
* Downloaded a bunch of mathematics books from [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) 
* Watched all of the shorts from week 4 of CS50
* Watched the lecture from week 5 of CS50

Time spent today: 5.42 hours  
Total time spent: 133.86 hours
