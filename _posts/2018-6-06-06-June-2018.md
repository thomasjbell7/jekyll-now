* Spent 40 minutes in the morning redoing part of my fifth FCC project as it was failing the twelfth test. Fixed this so it's now passing everything.
* Made a start on Basic JavaScript in FCC. 

I struggled to keep focus all evening because I felt really tired, but managed to get through it. There will be lots more days like today, but I need to power through!

Time spent today: 4.08 hours  
Total time spent: 48.40 hours
