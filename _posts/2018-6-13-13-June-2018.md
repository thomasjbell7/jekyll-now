* Watched all of the shorts fron 'week 1, continued' of CS50
* Completed and submitted the less comfortable 'mario' problem in pset 1
* Completed and submitted the less comfortable 'cash' problem in pset 1

I've decided that I'm going to do every single problem in CS50 which is why I went back and completed the less comfortable problems in pset 1 today. 

I also think that I might go back through the videos I've seen so far and start to collate a bunch of code examples. I think it will help me jog my memory and help me to decide what the best option is in a certain instance (e.g. when to use if-else-if vs case). I can then continue to collate it going forwards.
