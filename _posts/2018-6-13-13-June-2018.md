* Watched all of the shorts fron 'week 1, continued' of CS50
* Completed and submitted the less comfortable 'mario' problem in pset 1
* Completed and submitted the less comfortable 'cash' problem in pset 1
* Made a start on 'caesar' from pset 2

I've decided that I'm going to do every single problem in CS50 which is why I went back and completed the less comfortable problems in pset 1 today.

Time spent today: 4.57 hours  
Total time spent: 85.70 hours
